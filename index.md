I currently work as **Research Staff Member** at **IBM Research (Zürich lab)**.

My research interests lie mainly in the intersection of **formal logic** and **machine learning**.

My current work focuses on **reasoning**, inference mechanisms, automated theorem proving, probabilistic logic, neural-symbolic methods, neural embeddings for logic, deep learning for standard reasoning systems, and reasoning for **automated scientific discovery**.

Moreover, I have worked on knowledge representation and extraction, natural language processing, preference representations (in logic, in probability theory, and using graphical models), reasoning over preferences, preference aggregation in a multi-agent context, voting rules (computational social choice), and kidney exchange algorithms.
