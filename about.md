My research interests lie mainly in the intersection of **formal logic** and **machine learning**.

My current work focuses on **neuro-symbolic integrations**, **reasoning**, automated theorem proving, and **automated scientific discovery**.

Moreover, I have worked on knowledge representation and extraction, natural language processing, preference representations (in logic, probability theory, and using graphical models), reasoning over preferences, preference aggregation in a multi-agent context, voting rules (computational social choice), and kidney exchange algorithms.
